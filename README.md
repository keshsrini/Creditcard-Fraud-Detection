Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions from credit card data. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and predicts the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent based on various features.

Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant problem costing billions of dollars annually. Detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time is crucial for minimizing losses for both consumers and businesses. This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions based on historical credit card transaction data.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with only 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

Features
The dataset contains the following features:

Time: Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset
V1-V28: Principal components obtained with PCA (features are anonymized for confidentiality)
Amount: Transaction amount
Class: 1 for fraudulent transactions, 0 otherwise (target variable)

Usage
To use this project:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/keshavsrini/creditcard-fraud-detection.git
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb to see the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
Modify the notebook or scripts to fit your own dataset or experiment with different algorithms.
